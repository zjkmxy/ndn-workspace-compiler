LaTeX compiler server for [NDN Workspace](https://github.com/UCLA-IRL/ndn-workspace-solid).
Given that the WASM version is performant enough in all devices and supports caching files, there is no reason to use this compiler any more.
However, this repo can be a demo on how to use NDNts with deno, so I will keep it open and not archived.
